DJANGO
Accr
Create project
	=> django-admin startproject <Name Project>
	
	Run server 
	=> python manage.py runserver
		http://127.0.0.1:8000/
	
	In Django project create un app
		=> python manage.py startapp <Name App>
		in settings.py, INSTALLED_APPS is where django configures what apps are installed on this project and we have to add the new APP in the list
		
		=> access to th shell => pyhton manage.py shell


Faire afficher une page de mon APP => from 12:42 to 28:00
	1- views.py
		In order to create a view in django, we're going to define a function with a 'request' argument.
		The 'request' is going to represente th HTTP request that the user made in order to access our web server 
		
		# Create your views here.
			def index(request):
				return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")
		HttpResponse => is a class created by Django that we have to import 
		
	2- urls.py =>	For my app, we have to create the new file urls.py Where we define a variable list 'urlpatterns' 
					which will be a list of the allowable URLs tha can be accessed for this particalar APP
		urlpatterns = [
		path("", views.index, name="index"),
		path("brian", views.brian(), name='brian')
	]
		"" : is the URL that the client has to visit and views.index : is the result that we have to display when client visit URL
		
	3- 	Go to urls.py of the PROJECT in order to add a new path that will lead my APP
		path('app1/', include("app1.urls"))
		'app1/' : first term of the url of my APP and include("app1.urls") : second term of the urls from my APP
		
	4- test => http://127.0.0.1:8000/app1/ for the first path or http://127.0.0.1:8000/app1/brian for the second
	

PASS from HttpResponse to render 		
	# Create your views here.
		def index(request):
			return render(request,"app1/index.html")
	
	- create un folder "templates" in app1 folder / create another folder "app1" in templates folder refere to the "app1/index.html"

STATIC FILES
	- create un folder "static" in app1 folder / create another folder "app1" in static folder refere to the "app1/index.html" and create style.css
	- in a index.html add {% load static %} at the top 
	- add <link href="{% static 'newyear/style.css %}" rel="stylesheet"> in the head 
	

Introduction to the models 
	- Every model is a python class
	class Flight(models.Model):  # on crée une classe qui va hériter de models
		# les paramètres du model
		origin = models.CharField(max_length=64)
		destination = models.CharField(max_length=64)
		duration = models.IntegerField()
		duration = models.IntegerField()

		# Return a string representation of the object (Flight)
		def __str__(self):
			return f"{self.id} : {self.origin} to {self.destination}"
	
	- Type of Fields 
		- models.CharField(max_length=64)
		- models.IntegerField()
		- models.ForeignKey(Airport, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="departures") => To make reference to another table
		- models.ManyToManyField(Flight, blank=True, related_name='passengers') => blank=True : on accepte qu'un passager n'est pas de vol

	- Tell to Django to update the database to include information about the models created and that it's called : Migration
		- python manage.py makemigrations => after creating models
		- python manage.py migrate => apply the migration in the django's database
		- select Flight from * => Flight.objects.all()
		- 
		
Introduction to the admin App
In order to use it, we have to create : 
	- an administrate account inside of our Django web application => python manage.py createsuperuser
	- In admin.py : 
		from .models import Flight, Airport
		# Register your models here.
		admin.site.register(Airport)
		admin.site.register(Flight)
		
			- import the models => from .models import Flight, Airport
			- register the models to tell Django we want to use the admin App to be able to manipulate airports and flights 
				admin.site.register(Airport) 
				admin.site.register(Flight)
		
		It's possible to configure a admin interface in a particular way
